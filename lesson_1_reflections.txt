How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug 
that was introduced?

		- by writing diff old_file new_file

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?

		- by version control

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

		- you decide when to commit, and then can easily manage it

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

		- because there can be situation, that change in one file can
			affect other

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

		- entering git log we can see the history of commits on project
		- entering git diff, then the ID's which we want to compare, we
			can see what has been changed in the files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

		- 1. git log, and we must find the most recent ID, when we had bug
		- 2. git checkout ID

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

		- for becoming cool programmer
