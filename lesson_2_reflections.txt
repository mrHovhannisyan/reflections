What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

		- git init

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

		- working directory(WD) is our HDD
		- staging area(SA) is between WD and repository
		- after git add <file>, file is putted to SA
		- after git commit from SA to repo

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history 
organized? How would branches help?

		- we can create new branch(for example testing_branch) and test or
			change some files, and that changes will not affect main project
			on master branch

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
